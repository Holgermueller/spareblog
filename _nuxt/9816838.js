I'm a recent transplant to the town of\n        Batesville, Arkansas. This is my first time living in a southern\n        state, and I figured I'd use this blog as a way to record my\n        observations of where I'm living now. Some things haven't surprised\n        me, but quite a few things have pleasantly so in fact, and those will\n        be the things on which I focus on a irregulary regular basis, or is it\n        regularly irregular? Should my wife and I ever move again, I'll\n        document my thoughts and feelings about the new place where we live in\n        this blog as well.\n      ")]),e._v(" "),t("p",{staticClass:"about-paragraph"},[e._v("\n        How did I come to find myself here? My wife works in academia, and by\n        virtue of that, we live where she's able to get work. Why don't I get\n        a job somewhere else so we can live there? There're a few reasons for\n        that. First, my whole life, I've focused on getting the kind of job\n        that allows me to work anywhere I wanted. Did I have Arkansas in mind\n        when I decided that? No. And yes, I did have a job before we moved\n        here, which I quit when we moved here. But it was a retail job, so not\n        the kind of job around which you should base your major decisions in\n        life. Also, this job, the one my wife took, is the kind of job toward\n        which she had been working for her entire life, her dream job. Is the\n        location something she'd been working toward? No, the location is a\n        tad far from the dream.

Currently, I'm exploring new job opportunities.\n        That's the pleasant way of describing it. Prior to this I've been\n        employed in retail sales, selling clothes and books, not at the same\n        time. I've worked as an educator, teaching and tutoring English at a\n        community college in upstate New York. I've also taught English as a\n        foreign language in another country. I've worked as a ticket taker at\n        a movie theater. I've delivered phone books to people who in the best\n        cases were pretty much indifferent to receiving one. (In one case,\n        someone was a tad too angry about receiving one.) (Luckily, I never\n        encountered anyone who was super excited to receive one.)

I enjoy watching movies, with a\n        particular fondness for comedies and science fiction. I like music;\n        I'm fond of a variety of genres. Recently I've found myself listening\n        to reggae. The two genres I find myself always going back to are punk\n        rock and jazz. Some would say those to genres are at opposite ends of\n        the spectrum, but if you're familiar enough with them I think you find\n        they have more in common with each other than any other genre of\n        music. I enjoy hiking, which I'm in a pretty good location for, or so\n        I'm told. I like weight lifting, and the act of pushing myself to do\n        things I didn't know I could do that comes with it. And I love\n        reading, writing, and drawing. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention I\n        also enjoy spending time with my wife. And I love traveling. I've got\n        a pretty big bucket list of places I want to visit. The places I've\n        visited so far are Korea, Australia, Italy, and France. Hopefully,\n        once I've succeeded in searching through what my options are, I'll\n        land a job that helps facilitate my love of travel in some way.\n      ")]),e._v(" "),t("p",{staticClass:"about-paragraph"},[e._v("\n        So that's it for me.
